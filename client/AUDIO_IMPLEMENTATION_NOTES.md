# Audio Implementation Notes

## Overview

Audio has been fully implemented with Web Audio API for sound generation. The system works out-of-the-box without requiring external audio files.

## Sound Effects Added

### 1. **Walking Sound** (Player Movement)

- Plays a subtle footstep sound when the player moves
- Triggered every 200ms of movement
- Creates a rhythmic sound while walking

### 2. **Attack Sound** (Player Attacks Enemy)

- Plays when the player attacks an enemy (press X)
- Short, punchy sound effect
- Indicates a successful attack

### 3. **Kill Sound** (Enemy Defeated)

- Plays when an enemy is defeated
- Two-tone victory sound (400Hz + 500Hz)
- Celebratory audio feedback for kills

### 4. **Background Music** (Ambient Loop)

- Continuous ambient background music
- Very low volume (automatically set)
- Starts when the game session begins
- Stops when the session ends

## Enemy Visual Updates

### Different Enemy Sprites

- Enemies now use "bob" sprites from the players atlas
- Distinctive red tint (`#ff6b6b`) to visually distinguish from hero
- Use different animations: `onlinePlayer-*-walk` instead of `misa-*-walk`
- Easily identifiable as enemies on the map

## How to Add Your Own Audio Files (Optional)

If you want to replace the generated sounds with your own audio files:

### Step 1: Add Audio Files

Create an `audio` folder in `src/assets/` and add your audio files:

- `walk.mp3` - Walking sound effect
- `attack.mp3` - Attack sound effect
- `kill.mp3` - Kill sound effect
- `bgMusic.mp3` - Background music

### Step 2: Update AudioManager.js

Replace the generated sounds with actual audio files:

```javascript
// In Scene1.create(), add:
this.load.audio("walk", "assets/audio/walk.mp3");
this.load.audio("attack", "assets/audio/attack.mp3");
this.load.audio("kill", "assets/audio/kill.mp3");
this.load.audio("bgMusic", "assets/audio/bgMusic.mp3");
```

### Step 3: Update AudioManager Methods

In `AudioManager.js`, update the methods to use loaded sounds:

```javascript
playWalkSound() {
  if (this.scene.sound.get('walk')) {
    this.scene.sound.play('walk', { volume: 0.3 });
  } else {
    // Fallback to generated sound
    this.generateBeep(200, 0.05, 'sine');
  }
}
```

## Audio Features

- **Master Volume Control**: Set via `audioManager.setVolume(value)` (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Automatic Audio Context Resume**: Handles browser audio policy
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works without audio files using Web Audio API
- **Background Music Loop**: Automatically loops during gameplay
- **Low Volume Background**: Background music is set to 20% volume by default

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:

- Web Audio API
- AudioContext (with fallbacks)

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses Web Audio API to generate sounds, which means:

- ✅ No external audio files required
- ✅ Works immediately without setup
- ✅ Lightweight and performant
- ✅ Can be replaced with custom audio files anytime

All audio features are fully functional and ready to use!
