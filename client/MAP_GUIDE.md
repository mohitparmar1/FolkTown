# How to Create a Completely Different Map

## Option 1: Use Route1 (Simpler, Already Available)

I've switched your game to use `route1` which is a simpler, open grass area instead of the town. This gives you a cleaner, more open environment perfect for the battle arena.

## Option 2: Create Your Own Map with Tiled Map Editor (Recommended)

To create a completely different map with new buildings and style:

### Step 1: Download Tiled Map Editor

- Go to https://www.mapeditor.org/
- Download and install Tiled

### Step 2: Get New Tilesets

You can find free tilesets at:

- OpenGameArt.org (https://opengameart.org/)
- Kenney.nl (https://kenney.nl/assets - 100% free, no attribution required)
- Itch.io asset packs

Popular options:

- Modern/futuristic city tiles
- Fantasy RPG tiles
- Pixel art dungeon tiles
- Sci-fi spaceship tiles

### Step 3: Create Your Map

1. Open Tiled Map Editor
2. File → New → New Tileset
3. Add your tileset image
4. Create a new map (60x50 tiles, 32x32 tile size)
5. Add these layers:
   - "Below Player" (bottom layer)
   - "World" (collision layer, mark tiles as solid)
   - "Grass" (optional detail layer)
   - "Above Player" (things above player like trees)
6. Add Object Layers:
   - "SpawnPoints" - Add a spawn point object
   - "Worlds" - For map transitions (optional)
   - "Doors" - For doors (optional)

### Step 4: Save and Use Your Map

1. Save as JSON
2. Place in `src/assets/tilemaps/`
3. Update Scene1.js to load your map:

```javascript
// Add import at top
import YourMapJSON from "./assets/tilemaps/your_map.json";

// In preload()
this.load.tilemapTiledJSON("your_map", YourMapJSON);

// In create()
this.scene.start("playGame", {
  map: "your_map",
  playerTexturePosition: "front",
});
```

## Option 3: Programmatically Generated Map (Quick Solution)

If you want me to generate a custom procedural map in code, I can create an arena-style battlefield with obstacles and buildings programmatically. Just let me know what style you prefer!

## Current Setup

Right now your game loads on `route1` which is an open grass area - perfect for battles with enemies. The spawn point is at 960, 800 (center of the map).

## Quick Tips

- Maps are 60 tiles wide × 50 tiles tall
- Tile size is 32×32 pixels
- The "World" layer defines collision boundaries
- "SpawnPoints" layer is where players start
- "Grass" layer adds decorative details

Let me know if you want help with any of these options!
